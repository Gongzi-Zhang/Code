# PC Boot Process

FIRMWARE: BIOS-based,  EFI-based systems (Independent from disk and boot software)
GRUB(boot loader)
# BIOS
for BIOS booting process, BIOS will do POST(Power-On Self Test) to make
sure hardware availability, and then pass on system control to the MBR
(Main Boot Record: A small executable code which occupy the 0-446 Bytes
in the MBR sector, the following 64 Bytes is DPT(Disk Partition Table))

From how BIOS works, we can easily find that the combination of BIOS
and MBR is more about a convertion, rather than a technical limitation

Absoluty, MBR only support 4 primary records, but GPT( GUID Partition 
Table supports up to 128 record), so we would like to combine MBR with 
GPT, rather than MBR. Which is allow in Linux, but somewhat difficult
in Windows. refer to here for more:

Q1: how BIOS call MBR:
    Is BIOS call MBR to varify the DPT, and then find the OS loader, 
and then pass on system control to the OS loader; Or BIOS just pass
on system control to MBR, and do not take part in the following loadin
process at all, and it's MBR loads the OS loader?
