gdm: GNOME desktop manager
kdm: KDE desktop manager
xdm: X desktop manager
window manager: A window manager is a special X application that handles interactions for various applications that are displaying windows onscreen. You need a window manager to control the placement and size of each application’s window. Without a window manager, you cannot change a window’s location or alter its size.

socket: A socket is an abstraction that represents an endpoint of a connection. 
A socket has three attributes:

1. The network address (the IP address) of the system
2. The port number identifying the process that exchanges data through the socket
3. The type of socket (such as stream or datagram) identifying the protocol for data exchange
Essentially, the IP address identifies a network node, the port number identifies a process on the node, and the socket type determines the manner in which data is exchanged—through a connection-oriented or connectionless protocol.
