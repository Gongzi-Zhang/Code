\section{Renewcommand}
You can modify default command by the command \verb|\renewcommand| to make
it fit your personal situation.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Executive Summary}	% Modify the title of your abstract
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\triangleright$}
\renewcommand{\labelitemii}{\ding{43}}
\renewcommand{\labelitemiii}{\ding{44}}
\renewcommand{\labelitemiv}{\ding{45}}
\end{lstlisting}

\setlength{\paperwidth}{48in} 
\setlength{\paperheight}{36in}

\setlength{\onecolwid}{0.22\paperwidth} % Width of one column
\setlength{\twocolwid}{0.464\paperwidth} % Width of two columns
\setlength{\threecolwid}{0.708\paperwidth} % Width of three columns

\section{New Command}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\newcommand{\SB}{Stony Brook}
\end{lstlisting}
Note that if type only \verb|\SB|, then the macro will eat up the following
space, producing ugly layout. To avoid that, you have to invoke it with an
empty statement after it: \verb|\SB{}|. 

The reason behind this is that \LaTeX ignores space directly after the
macro(which just stop the scanning for the macro's name). You need to break
that using either a protected space \verb|\SB\ | or an empty statement
\{\}.An empty statement is recommanded, as using a protected space can
generate nasty effects -- for example, if that protected space is directly
followed by a line break. In that case \LaTeX might pring two spaces
instead. Using an empty statement prevents this.

\verb|\def| command in {\bf plain \TeX{}} also do the work.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\def\intwrtx#1{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} #1 \,dx}
\end{lstlisting}
\def\intwrtx#1{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} #1 \,dx}
e.g.
$$ \intwrtx{f(x)}.$$

\subsection{xcolor}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\colorlet{LightRubinRed}{RubineRed!70!}	% xcolor; 70% or the intersity of 
% original RubineRed color. Or you can think of it as a mixture of 70% RubineRed
% and 30% white.
\colorlet{mycolor1}{green!10!orange!90!}
\definecolor{mycolor2}{HTML}{00F9DE}	% HTML model, the character A,B,C,D,E and F must be upper-case.
\end{lstlisting}

The color models that only \textbf{xcolor} support are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{cmy} cyan, magenta, yellow
    \item \textbf{hsb} hue, saturation, brightness
    \item \textbf{HTML} RRGGBB
    \item \textbf{Gray} Grey scale, a number between 1 and 15.
    \item \textbf{wave} Wave length. Between 363 and 814    	
\end{itemize}
