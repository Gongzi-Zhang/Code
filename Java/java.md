# data type
## primitive data type
* boolean	A 1-bit value that contains true or false. A boolean value is not an integer.
* byte		An 8-bit signed integer with values between -128 and 127
* char		A 16-bit unsigned integer value representing a Unicode character 
* double	A 64-bit, double-precision floating-point value in the IEEE 754 format 
* float		A 32-bit, single-precision floating-point value in IEEE 754 format
* int		A 32-bit signed integer with values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
* long		A 64-bit signed integer with values between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
* short		A 16-bit signed integer with values between -32,768 and 32,767.
## Nonprimitive Data Types
    The nonprimitive data types in Java are objects and arrays. All nonprimitive types are handled by reference-that means when you pass a nonprimitive type to a method, the address of the object is passed to the method. The primitive types, however, are passed by value-that means a copy of the data is passed to the method.
