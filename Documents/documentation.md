# How to write good technical documentation

## Tutorials: teaching a small child how to cook
* is learning-oriented
* allows the newcomer to get started
* is a lesson

## How-to guides: a recipe in a cookery book
* is goal-oriented
* show how to solve a specific problem
* step by step

## explanation: an article on culinary social history
* is understanding-oriented
* explains
* provides background and context

## reference: a reference encyclopedia article
* is information-oriented
* describes the machinery
* is accurate and complete

A manual is something between how-to and explaination (or the combination of how-to and explaination)
