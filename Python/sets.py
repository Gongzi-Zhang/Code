# Sets are a sequence type that is unordered and does not have 
#+ duplicates. Sets are mutable and elements can be added to an 
#+ existing set. But if a set already has an identical element, a 
#+ duplicate is not added. Sets are created by passing a sequence 
#+ type to the set() built-in function.

# Sets support set operations such as union, intersection, difference 
#+ and symmetric difference. The operators are
'''
âˆ’
  Difference. Returns elements that are in one set but not in the 
  other
|
  Logical OR. Elements in either one set or the other.
&
  Logical AND. Elements that are in both sets.
^
    Logical Exclusive OR. Elements in either set but not both.
