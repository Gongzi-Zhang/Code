# Histogram
When a histogram is drawn, a TPaveStats object is created and added to the list of functions of the histogram. If a TPaveStats object already exists in the histogram list of funcitons, the existing object is just updated with the current histogram parameters.

With the option "same", the statistic box is not redrawn.
With the option "sames", the statistic box is drawn.
