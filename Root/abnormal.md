* only one bin near 0 in a histogram plot, then probably no variable value  is read at all, check **variable address**, **tree branch** etc.
* if you draw the first plot in a canvas (pad) with the "same" option, **nothing** will be drew.
* !!! if you draw the second (or any following) picture with the draw option: " same" (note the space before same), only the first picture will be shown. So in order to superimpose multi-pictures, you need the draw option: "same".
