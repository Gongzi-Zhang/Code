# Purpose
The aim of **Markdown** is to achive easier reading and writing.
Markdown is affected by text-to-HTML formats, among them, pure text email is the dominant one.

# Compatibility with HTML
Markdown is aim to become a easy network language, rather than replacing HTML.

Markdown's syntax only correspond to little part of HTML language.

Markdown intends to create such doc. which is more friendly to reading, writing and modifing.

HTML is used for publishing, while markdown aims for writing, therefore, Markdown only covers
those areas that can be shown with pure text. Everything that can not be displayed with Markdown
can be shown with HTML. no need to mark it, just add those marks.
