* Js is a OO programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a **host environment**. A web browser provides a host environment for client-side computation. A web server provides a different host environment for server-side computation.

* An **object** is a collection of zero or more properties each with attributes that determine how each property can be used. Properties are containers that hold other objects: primitive values or functions.
  an object is an instance of the built-in type **Object**; and a function is a callable object; a function that is associated with an object via a property is called a method.

* In Js, **null** is not a reference to a non-existing object or a null pointer. It's just a special value which represents "nothing", "empty" or "value unknown"

* Functions:
    parameters of function are passed by a copy of value
    A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.For example, a global Function Declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is.
