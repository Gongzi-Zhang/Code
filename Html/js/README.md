# DOM
[DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)
DOM is a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs
and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and
style of documents. The document can be further processed and theresults of
that processing can be incorporated back into the precented page.

## event

## window
**window** object represents something like the browser

## document
**document** object is the root of the document itself

## element
**element** inherits from the generic **node** interface, and together these 
two interfaces provide many of the methods and properties you use on
individual elements.
