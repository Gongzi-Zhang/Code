# rule
1.  An expression involving only exact (symbolic) quantities will be 
    evaluated exactly (symbolically), while an expression involving one or
    more floating numbers will be evaluated approximately using floating 
    point arithmetic.
    
2.  Parentheses() are reserved for algebraic grouping, square brackets[]
    for function evaluation, and curly brackets{} for lists, double square
    brackets[[]] for the indexing operator.
