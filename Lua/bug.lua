--> key of table <--
x = {a=10, b=20}    --> in table constructor, key is not a string
x["a"]		    --> but for evaluation, key is a string

--> return <--
Beware that a return statement does not need parentheses around the returned
value; any pair of parentheses placed there counts as an extra pair. So, a
statement like return (f(x)) always returns one single value, no matter how
many values f returns.
